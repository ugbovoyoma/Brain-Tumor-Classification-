## 📝 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates an application of foundational deep learning techniques using a supervised image classification task. It involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between different classes of images. The project includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- CNN model building
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance visualisation and interpretation
